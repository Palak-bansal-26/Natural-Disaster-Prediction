# Natural-Disaster-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning 

## Overview

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, forest fires, and avalanches pose significant risks to communities worldwide. The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict these natural disasters, enabling timely interventions to minimize their impact. This project involves analyzing and forecasting the occurrence of these disasters using historical and real-time data.

## Project Description

The system presented in this project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of natural disasters. The key aspects of the project include:

- **Disasters Covered**: Earthquakes, Floods, Forest Fires, Avalanches
- **Features Used**: Temperature, Rainfall, Geographical Locations, and other relevant factors
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy (95-100% for the best model), R2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and other evaluation metrics

The project involves:
1. Data Collection: Gathering historical and real-time data relevant to the disasters.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. Model Training: Applying machine learning techniques to train models on the data.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of different models and selecting the best-performing one.
5. Comparative Analysis: Comparing various machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for disaster forecasting.
